Dear Webmaster,

Welcome and thank you for choosing NetNation Communications.

This email contains important information about your
DOMAIN NAME, UPLOAD ACCESS, EMAIL ACCESS, SOFTWARE and SUPPORT.

DOMAIN NAME
(theawningfactory.net)
If this is a new domain name, the registration has been submitted to the
DomainPeople registrar on your behalf. The cost for the first two years of
registration (US) will have been included in the invoice. Note that you
should receive an email from DomainPeople verifying the registration within
several days.

If you have an existing domain and are "transfering" it to Netnation, our
domains department will contact you with instructions to transfer the
domain. Or submit a request to make the change directly to the registry.

It normally takes 2-3 business days for DomainPeople to process domain name
registration applications. Once your domain name is registered, it takes
about 24 hrs for the DNS information to propagate through the Internet.

To determine if your domain name is registered & fully propagated point your 
browser to:

	http://connect.netnation.com

While waiting for DomainPeople or the appropriate registrar to finish 
processing your domain, you can view your site at 
http://granite.netnation.com/~theawnin

Here is the basic information you need to get started with your website.

UPLOAD ACCESS
